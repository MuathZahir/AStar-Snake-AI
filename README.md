# AStar-Snake-AI üêç
## Description
I used the A* algorithm to create an AI for the Snake Game, this was my first time playing with this algorithm. Even though I realized half-way through the project that using the A* algorithm is not the best way to create an AI for this game, it was a valuable learning experience and I was pretty happy with how it turned out at the end.

## Controls
The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys, pressing the spacebar will toggle between AI mode and play mode. When in AI mode, the speed of the snake can be increased or decreased using the right and left arrows. Pressing the escape key swithes to the main menu screen.

## Thoughts
Using the A* algorithm meant that the snake is always looking for the shortest path to the fruit, which is not always favorable. This can lead to the snake getting stuck with no way out. While working on this project, I thought up a couple of different approaches to this problem that I will be investigating in the future.
